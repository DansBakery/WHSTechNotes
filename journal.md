Ultrakill, Pizza Tower, Celeste, Bloodthief... I want to make a speed game. Let's do it.
Progress so far: Basic Movement, Ground Pound... and that's it.
Next goals: add speed boost when jumping after ground pound, add speed cap.

what is this, english class? a 5 scentence paragraph about the lack of phones? sure. it's dumb. the school computers have so many restrictions. you can't use like half of google. but more importantly, i can't take pictures. I NEED TO TAKE PICTURES FOR ART CLASS. also, during lunch too? what do you expect us to do, sit there the whole time doing nothing? oh, and what if there's a last-miunite change to a schedule? say i have robotics until 6:30, but it gets canceled. i'd have no way of knowing. even if i did, i can't tell my parents until it's too late. if they don't know, they can't pick me up, so i have to wait at the school for however long it takes them to arrive. ugh. i hope this is enough.

(wow, this really IS english class, huh?)
A career i am interested in is creating videos online for people to watch. yeah, there's not much to explain here, it literally IS computer science. it would not exist without computers. especially vtubing, the specific branch i want to go into. i can't really say much else about it.
