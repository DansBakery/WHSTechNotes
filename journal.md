Ultrakill, Pizza Tower, Celeste, Bloodthief... I want to make a speed game. Let's do it.
Progress so far: Basic Movement, Ground Pound... and that's it.
Next goals: add speed boost when jumping after ground pound, add speed cap.

what is this, english class? a 5 scentence paragraph about the lack of phones? sure. it's dumb. the school computers have so many restrictions. you can't use like half of google. but more importantly, i can't take pictures. I NEED TO TAKE PICTURES FOR ART CLASS. also, during lunch too? what do you expect us to do, sit there the whole time doing nothing? oh, and what if there's a last-miunite change to a schedule? say i have robotics until 6:30, but it gets canceled. i'd have no way of knowing. even if i did, i can't tell my parents until it's too late. if they don't know, they can't pick me up, so i have to wait at the school for however long it takes them to arrive. ugh. i hope this is enough.

(wow, this really IS english class, huh?)
A career i am interested in is creating videos online for people to watch. yeah, there's not much to explain here, it literally IS computer science. it would not exist without computers. especially vtubing, the specific branch i want to go into. i can't really say much else about it.

We, yes WE, you me and everyone else, HATE AI
so my idea? create an ai program to detect any ai generated content and leak the creator's IP address.
...that's... about it. 5 whole scentences? english is my worst subject, i'm not taking this class just for it to be another writing class...
although it's not like i've been working on my game much. i've been geting to distracted by the features i already have, i just keep playing it rather than actually working on it. whoops. actually, isn't that what happened with Silksong? yeah, this'll be great.

Working virtual jobs in the future? surely you jest... it is simply absurd that you will be able to, in the future, make money virtually.
you can do it NOW!
there are several virtual jobs, even ignoring... whatever ikea's trying to do. which, what exactly is it? working in a virtual store? for real money? that i don't understand.

Humanity has lived far too long. this "god" guy was onto something when he flooded the earth, maybe we should do that again.

personally, i'd ban ai websites and obviously anything innaproppriate, but besides that, i'd leave it up to the teachers to regulate their own students. i also wouldn't ban phones.
